scp: secure copy

when you want to copy the file between  two Linux os using ssh

scp <nameoffile>  username@ipaddress:/<location

expample 
scp /tmp/task2.txt  amit@192.168.111.130:/home/amit/

The SCP command enables you to conveniently copy files from remote machines to local nodes. You can also use this command to copy files from a virtual machine to the local host

Now How will I practices?

Shell practices: You need to create story?

Devops:  Developers+Operations: It is methodology to implement software devolpment life cycle


Developer: Write the code 

Why developer code? Either they are building a new software or they are fixing the issues.


What is the operations? When product has to install in production and do the production take care



Whenever developer fix code--->build package-->test the package-->apply it in production


We are designing a flow where code fix will be package,tested and deployed in the production.

Pipeline


Whatever you are seeing in playstore-->apk package, exe, msi, rpm ,deb
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SDLC: Software development life cycle:

-->They plan : Why I need it? Is customer has some demand? (Planning is the first phase)

--> Writing the code

--> Test code ( Functional,system testing)

--> Deliver product


Water fall model

  |__
 

up to down (plan (completed)-->coding +Testing--> (need lot procees, that takes times)

2 to 3 years..


But current sceranio, everyone is releasing product in 6 month -1 year

Samsung/Apple/Microsoft


Agile: Any time I want to change anything? can I change?


--->Whenever devolper fix anything--> can we automate this process to complete rest of stuf


code->build->Test-->release

As or when any developer in the product make change, can we go create package and test it out..



software -->100 dev

dev->code change-->immediately-->there is issue-->I can go and revert the DEv A change



----

dev A,B,C,D-->face the issue-->4 dev chagnes-->which code change is failing

CI/CD-->Continuous intergration and continuous delivery (pipeline)

do you know git?
---------------------------


You as developer-->you write code--->60 of us working together-->then how we will share and intergrate code?


Dev->website

3 dev--

1 dev-->Db for website-->In their dev box

1 dev-->frontend

1 dev->middleware

What I need to do to create website??


Intergrate code-->

WE need to publish the code to source code management sites.

git and GitHub

-------------------------------------------

What is git?

You need to manage that code. source code management?


Version control system

Suppose as dev-->you are fixing code-->testing out-->
 code is failing-->you try to revert it


When ever you are making the code changes, you must enable the tracking so in -case of failure you revert badc

--->code--> abc-->v1-->describption in the message

--->def-->v2

--> def-->v3

--->hij-->v4

Recording the code change using version


---------------

git-->git is a application for version control. It is by default available in Linux system

You can install on windows and macos
------------------------------------------------------------


Using the git we will do the version control?

What is GitHub/GitLab/bitbucket? Hosting website to host the git projects.

-----------------------------------

What is git Bash for?
Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience. Bash is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell. A shell is a terminal application used to interface with an operating system through written commands.


git init command will covert a directoy into git repository.

git init will create a subdirectory .git, which will do the version control
