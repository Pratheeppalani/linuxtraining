OS: What is operation system?

Android : OS (CPU scheduling and memory management)

Software which manages the hardware. It takes the command from user and execute on the h/w.

OS: Linux, windows, ios

Linux is an OS, which is developed on Unix os

Unix initial os:develop by bell labs (Dannis Rechie and Ken Tompson)

Linux : Devloped on Top unix os: Linus Torvalds. Opensource os

--Cli based os
-- When you go and see your production impletantion, it will non gui environment.
-- It gives good performance. It is not easy for others to perfrom
-- EC2 vm  (Linux flavour) : Graphics interface
-- Security, its not that easy to use for non-tech persons

Difference between Linux vs Unix:

Unix os: doesn't have user friendly interfaces, not easy to install
-- Not many scripting support was available in case unix os
-- Multi  users env.
-- Not many packages has developed


------------------
What is authentication: Login to the system authentication
basic authentication: user name + password
ssh authentication--> key pair (ppk file,pem file)

username@<public ip of ec2 instance)
Private key


Ssh-->key pair authentication ( private key, public key)

I am initating private key with key, and upload the public key to the ec2 system

-->encrypt the handshake using private key(pem,ppk file)------>decrpt it using public

----------------------------------------

Distribution:

Variation of Linux. Linux opensource project

Debian, Fedora, Centos (Rocky Linux), Rhel, Ubuntu, suse Linux

Enterprise level: We need to take licence [Commerical use]
The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a free software license that guarantees end-users the freedom to use, study, share, and modify the software.

----------------
Login: username
password:<just type it, it will show anything)

1) You should know the basic commands

#How to create  a directory

mkdir testing

# How to go inside the directory

cd testing

#List all file

ls 

ls -ltr

ls -la

# How to come out from directory

cd ..
-----------------------

What is openshift?

Openshift is redhat enterprise solution for Kubernetes and containers. Its a software for
container management

Kubernetes: Opensource project from Linux foundation  Container management tool

Openshift Redhat
VMware Tanzu VMware
Rancher: Suse Linux
aks: Microsoft azure
eks: aws
gke: google

---------------------------------

In ubuntu/debian package installer is apt
APT (Advanced Package Tool) is the default package manager for Ubuntu, a tool used for installing, updating, and removing software (deb)

you will be using "apt" command

DNF (Dandified YUM) is a package manager for RPM-based Linux distributions like Fedora, Rocky Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It's the successor to YUM(rpm)

It's important to understand that certain Linux distributions default to either AppArmor or SELinux. For example, RHEL, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, CentOS Stream and Fedora all use SELinux.

On the other hand, Ubuntu, Debian, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, openSUSE and most all Ubuntu/Debian derivatives use AppArmor.

-------------------------

Two types of package:
--Default packages which is the part of os image.

--Third party packages, you need to manually map the third party repository and then install it
------------

 apt-get install apache2
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), are you root?
------------

When you want to install package in any Linux, you must have root rights.

root (superuser)/ Administrator of windows: User who has administrative privlideges

----
you need to download the latest package list..

sudo  apt-get update
--------------------------------

What is sudo?
In Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, "sudo" (short for "superuser do") is a command-line utility that allows users to run commands with elevated privileges, effectively acting as the root user without logging out of their regular account. 

---------------------
It is not necessary that all the users are the part of sudo group

user  is not in the sudoers file. These user cannot perform any activity where super user privlidges are required


All the Linux os configuration information store under /etc

In a Linux system, the /etc directory serves as the central repository for system-wide configuration files. It contains various files that control the behavior of the operating system and its installed applications.
