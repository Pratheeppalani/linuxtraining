Day 2 Linux

Linux OS: Debian/ubuntu

-------------------------------------
Some basic Linux cli

Where exactly you execute the command in Linux?

Shell: Interface where you can connect and execute the command

The shell is the Linux command line interpreter. It provides an interface between the user and 
the kernel and executes programs called commands.

Shell

os
-----
hardware

Shell is program: bash,sh,zsh,ksh[each shell has own properties]

On most Linux systems a program called bash (which stands for Bourne Again SHell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, sh,
 written by Steve Bourne) acts as the shell program. Besides bash, there are other shell programs available for Linux systems.
 These include: ksh, tcsh and zsh.

--------------------------------------------------

Shell scripting: All of this shell support commands. 

you will writing the command in file and executing it out. and the file extension will ".sh"

-------------

Linux editor [vi and nano]


1) If i want to open a file using vi:[ If file is there, it will open that one, or else it will create new file

vi testfile.sh

2) If you want add something, you will enable the insert mode by pressing "i"

3) Then if you want to save it, come out from the insert mode by pressing: esc

4) If you want to save file  :wq+enter

5) If you don't want to save file :q!

-----------

Touch nd VI? touch is used to create empty files or update file timestamps, without opening or modifying the file's content. 
vi, on the other hand, is a text editor used to open, edit, and save file contents interactively
cat is for reading file.

1) Create a file with .sh extension

2)The shell command interpreter is the command line interface between the user and the operating system

3) #!/bin/bash, #!/usr/bin/python, #!/usr/bin/perl

4) #!she-bang

-------------------------------------------

Use case:

Shell scripting widely used for routine 

apt-get install apahce2

1) Manager gives you 	assignment develop a shell script to install a pacakge : 

   Before writing the code: Flow charts

  1) Check the package is already installed or not?

  2) If yes-->exit

  3) If no--> ask the user do you want to install the package

  4) If yes-->proceed
  
  5) IF pacakge is running some , check that service is running not

----------------------------------

A variable in Bash is a symbolic name that stores a value, which can be a string or a number. Variables are used to store and
 manipulate data within scripts or commands. 
Defining a Variable

To define a variable in Bash, you use the following syntax:

variable_name=value

package="apache2"


The echo command in Bash is used to display text or variables to the standard output, typically the terminal. It's a fundamental command for shell scripting and interacting with the command line.
Basic Usage: To display a simple message.
echo "Hello, World!

Using the read command:
The read command is the primary way to get input from the user. It reads a line from standard input and assigns it to a variable.

read variable_name


Conditional statement

read -p "Do you want to proceed? (yes/no) " answer

if [[ "$answer" == "yes" || "$answer" == "y" || "$answer" == "Y" || "$answer" == "YES" ]]; then
  echo "Proceeding..."
  # Code to execute if the user answers yes
else
  echo "Exiting..."
  # Code to execute if the user answers no or invalid
  exit 1
fi

----------------

# Step 1: Check if package is installed
if dpkg -l | grep -q "^ii\s\+$PACKAGE"; then
    echo "$PACKAGE is already installed."
    # Step 5: Check if the service is running
    if systemctl is-active --quiet $PACKAGE; then
        echo "Service $PACKAGE is running."
    else
        echo "Service $PACKAGE is not running. Starting it..."
        sudo systemctl start $PACKAGE
    fi
    exit 0
fi

# Step 3: Ask user for installation
read -p "$PACKAGE is not installed. Do you want to install it? (y/n): " answer
if [[ "$answer" =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    echo "Installing $PACKAGE..."
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y $PACKAGE
    echo "$PACKAGE installed."

    # Step 5: Start the service
    echo "Starting $PACKAGE service..."
    sudo systemctl start $PACKAGE
    echo "$PACKAGE service started."
else
    echo "Installation aborted by user."
    exit 1
fi
